"""
A [company] Fulfillment Associate has a set of items that need to be packed into two boxes. Given an integer array of the item weights (arr) to be packed, divide the item weights into two subsets, A and B, for packing into the associated boxes, while respecting the following conditions:


- The intersection of A and B is null.
- The union A and B is equal to the original array.
- The number of elements in subset A is minimal.
- The sum of A's weights is greater than the sum of B's weights.


Return the subset A in increasing order where the sum of A's weights is greater than the sum of B's weights. If more than one subset A exists, return the one with the maximal total weight.


Example:
n = 5
arr = [3, 7, 5, 6, 2]


The 2 subsets in arr that satisfy the conditions for A are [5, 7] and  [6, 7]:

- A is minimal (size 2)
- Sum(A) = (5 + 7) = 12 > Sum(B) = (2 + 3 + 6) = 11
- Sum(A) = (6 + 7) = 13 > Sum(B) = (2 + 3 + 5) = 10
- The intersection of A and B is null and their union is equal to arr.
- The subset A where the sum of its weight is maximal is [6, 7].

Function Description:

Complete the minimal_heaviest_setA function.

minimal_heaviest_setA has the following parameter(s):
- int arr[]: an integer array of the weights of each item in the set


Returns:
- int[] : an integer array with the values of subset A

---

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 105
- 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105 (where 0 ≤ i < n)

---

Input Format For Custom Testing:
- The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in the array.
- Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains an integer, which is an element of arr.

Explanation

n = 6

arr = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2]



The subset of A that satisfies the conditions is [4, 5]:

- A is minimal (size 2)
- Sum(A) = (4 + 5) = 9 > Sum(B) = (1 + 2 + 2 +  3) = 8
- The intersection of A and B is null and their union is equal to arr.

The subset A with the maximal sum is [4, 5].
